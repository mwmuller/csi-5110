Kuber is a container manager
Is this a container swapping mechanism?
(Application swapping within the kuber pods. (May also swap containers?))

Look up LUA
Were there any application examples which would change based on network status?
Whats contained within the messages which are being managed? -> Messages contain scripts or information for the application managed in the kuber pod


This could be used with Gemini to adjust the screen res input to the ECM.
However, Gemini is edge processing. Where as BB is for streaming?So the edge device is strictly the camera?

No conn -> Edge
Some conn -> reduced res and edge device
Full con -> Fill res and cloud.

Do they discuss the model used on edge/cloud

Case B:
Did they discuss what is deined as a"high priority" message

What metric is measured when determining deadlines? I assume "View" takes more time to process? So dropping these is the best because they require more compute power.

**Are "view" types more compute heavy? Did this describe?**

Glorified predictive data filtering system?
Did they mention any other related works? Or just the baseline
